# EV Charging Data Analyis - Power BI 

# Project Overview
The EV Charging Data Analysis project aims to analyze electric vehicle (EV) charging trends, customer behavior, station performance, and revenue generation using Power BI. The insights derived help optimize charging station operations, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance profitability.

# Technologies Used
Power BI â€“ Data visualization & dashboard creation
Excel â€“ Data cleaning & preprocessing
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) â€“ Advanced calculations & measures

# Key Objectives
Understand charging trends over time
Analyze customer behavior based on subscription plans
Evaluate charging station performance
Assess revenue patterns & profitability
Optimize charging station operations using data insights

ðŸ“Š Power BI Dashboard Insights
ðŸ”¹ 1. Time-Based Charging Trends
ðŸ“Œ Peak Charging Hours: High demand between 6 PM - 9 PM
ðŸ“Œ Weekday vs. Weekend Usage: More sessions recorded on weekends
ðŸ“Œ Monthly Trends: Growing EV adoption observed over time

ðŸ”¹ 2. Charging Station Performance
ðŸ“Œ Top Stations by Energy Consumption: Station ST0003 had the highest energy usage
ðŸ“Œ Station Utilization Heatmap: Identified underperforming stations for optimization
ðŸ“Œ Revenue per Station: Helped determine most profitable locations

ðŸ”¹ 3. Customer Behavior Analysis
